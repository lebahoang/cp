”Boxes and balls” is a useful model, where we count the ways to place k balls in n
boxes. Let us consider three scenarios:

Scenario 1: Each box can contain at most one ball.
  In this scenario, the answer is directly the binomial coefficient C(n,k)


Scenario 2: A box can contain multiple balls.
  The process of placing the balls in the boxes can be represented as a string
that consists of symbols ”o” and ”→”. Initially, assume that we are standing at
the leftmost box. The symbol ”o” means that we place a ball in the current box,
and the symbol ”→” means that we move to the next box to the right.
Using this notation, each solution is a string that contains k times the symbol
”o” and n−1 times the symbol ”→”. For example, the upper-right solution in the
above picture corresponds to the string ”→ → o → o →”. Thus, the number of
solutions is C(k+n-1, k)


Scenario 3: Each box may contain at most one ball, and in addition, no two
adjacent boxes may both contain a ball.
  In this scenario, we can assume that k balls are initially placed in boxes and
there is an empty box between each two adjacent boxes. The remaining task is
to choose the positions for the remaining empty boxes. There are n−2k +1 such
boxes and k + 1 positions for them. Thus, using the formula of scenario 2, the
number of solutions is C(n-k+1, n-2k+1)
